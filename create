To create this typing animation webpage, you need these key elements:

1.Basic HTML Structure: To define the document, content, and elements you want to animate.

<!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, <body>, and related tags.
Elements like <div> to contain the text and cursor.

2.CSS Styling and Animations:

Style the body for background color, layout, and centering content.
Style the text container with font properties, colors, spacing.
Create @keyframes animations for the typing effect (expanding the width) and blinking cursor (opacity change).
Use CSS animation properties to run these animations with timing and repeat settings.
Responsive font sizes using viewport units (vw).

3.Meta viewport tag: To ensure responsive scaling on different screen sizes, especially mobile.
